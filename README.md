# The idea

This is a prototype app for how an ai might be used to match potential collaborators/conference attendees/etc based on some similar interests/topics that could be captured from each person via a pre-workshop/conference survey perhaps.

most of the ui is done, but the ai was one through a manual chat with chatgpt-4o and people information email through for their profiles.

but it wouldnt take much to improve on this to make it more robust for an actual event/org/conference/etc.
